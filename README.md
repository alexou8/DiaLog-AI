# DiaLog — Diabetes Tracking + ML Pattern Insights (Informational Only)

DiaLog is an AI-powered diabetes tracking and machine learning insight platform that analyzes
nutrition intake, medication timing, and glucose readings to surface **personalized, non-medical
pattern insights**.

An end-to-end ML pipeline that:
- stores diabetes-related logs (meals, meds, glucose) locally in SQLite
- preprocesses & engineers time-based features
- trains an ML classifier to estimate the probability of a "spike event"
- tunes hyperparameters
- generates weekly insights reports

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is for **informational and educational purposes only**.  
It does **not** provide medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or medication recommendations.
All outputs are intended solely to highlight data patterns and trends.

## Key Features
- Structured logging of meals, medication events, and glucose readings
- Time-aware feature engineering (meal proximity, carb intake, medication timing)
- Machine learning–based glucose spike pattern detection
- Automated weekly insight and trend reporting
- Modular, maintainable codebase following software engineering best practices

## Machine Learning Overview
- **Problem Type:** Binary classification (glucose spike event detection)
- **Target Definition:** Glucose readings exceeding a configurable threshold
- **Feature Types:**
  - Temporal features (time of day, day of week)
  - Time since last meal / medication
  - Carbohydrate intake
  - Medication context
- **Model:** Random Forest classifier with class balancing
- **Evaluation:** ROC-AUC, precision, recall

The project prioritizes **interpretability, robustness, and data quality** over raw prediction
accuracy.
